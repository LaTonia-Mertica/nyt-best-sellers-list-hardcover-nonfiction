# NYT Selected Best Sellers List
*solid exercise for alternative and multiple placement of scripts in html, hard-coded versus dynamically populated images, using id to display content called through api in separate javascript file. .. using axios, shuffle to reorganize books each load, localStorage for favorites feature, and let statements:*

let books;
let htmlToUpdate = "";
let htmlGridToUpdate = "";
let imgsToUpdate = "";

*to establish toggle between list and grid views*

**HOW WORKS**
<br>
scroll left-to-right in header for full list of books, click toggle view to switch, click bookmark icon to select/de-select favorites, click headphones icon in list view to listen to selected playlist in both views, and click book image or title to purchase a copy 

**NEXT STEP**
<br>
add favorites and playlist in grid view in stylistically optimized design/format

## MY BACK STORY
<br>
I went into code because I saw code as a gateway to better options, informed risk-taking, and outcomes. 
<br>
<br>
My fantasies on a better life are nothing special. A better life, life quality, and sense of self. A life during which I create opportunities for the substance of my existence. A life I enthusiastically own. A life that welcomes, entertains, and bows to parts of myself I've envisioned embracing for too long - focusing on non-me things out of a sense of duty, and obligation, and misaligned timing. Nothing special. Still, my own, and true difference.  
<br>
<br>
When I was notified I was accepted into Hack Upstate full stack javascript code/web dev bootcamp Careers in Code, I knew my life was changed. 
<br>
<br>
Far from perfect, and likely destined to never truly achieve the level and status I fantasize on, I code every day. I apply my best self. Dwell in the moment - to moment. Never forget how hard life has been at times. And that debatably I shouldn't be alive today. But I am. Building out the purpose of my life is a lot to do - and I still don't have authenticated clarity on it. 
<br>
<br>
Still, it involves vigorous exceptional communication - and, coding is now part of my fierce means to say some things.
